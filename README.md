# python-shopping-cart

This is a simple menu-driven shopping cart program written in Python. It uses two classes, `ItemToPurchase` and `ShoppingCart`, to let a user add items, remove items, change quantities, view descriptions, and print out a full shopping cart summary.

This project was completed as my Portfolio Project for CSC500.

## How It Works

The program runs in the terminal and guides the user step-by-step:

1. The user enters their name and the current date.
2. A `ShoppingCart` object is created using that information.
3. A menu appears with options to manage the cart.
4. The menu repeats until the user chooses to quit.

## Features

- Quit program

## Files Included

**final_portfolio.py**  
Main Python program containing the classes and menu logic.

**Portfolio_Project.docx**  
Write-up explaining the project and what I learned.

## How to Run the Program

1. Install Python 3.
2. Place `final_portfolio.py` in a folder.
3. Open a terminal in that folder.
4. Run:

```
python final_portfolio.py
```

The program will walk you through everything from there.

## What I Learned

Working through this project helped me get more comfortable with:
- Classes and objects
- Structuring Python programs
- Using lists and loops
- Building interactive text-based menus

When I started CSC500, these concepts were completely new to me, but by the time I got to this final project, things were beginning to click. This project helped bring everything together in one place.
